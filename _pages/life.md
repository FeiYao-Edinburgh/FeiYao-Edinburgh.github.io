Life and academy are mutually beneficial. I would like to travel ten thousand miles as well as read ten thousand [books](https://feiyao-edinburgh.github.io/files/books.pdf). Pursuing PhD abroad have also made me gradually familiar and fascinated with [cooking](https://feiyao-edinburgh.github.io/files/cooking.slides.html). Occasionally I explore [objects in Earth orbit](http://stuffin.space/).
