Dr Yao is a post-doctoral fellow working with Prof. Paul Palmer at the School of GeoSciences, the University of Edinburgh which is also the place where he obtained his PhD degree in Atmospheric and Environmental Science. Before joining the University of Edinburgh, he obtained his Master’s degree in Geography from Peking University, the best university in China, while he obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Geographical Information Science from East China Normal University, another famous university in China.

The long-term goal of Dr Yao’s research is to utilize Earth observation data and state-of-art models to address important scientific and technical questions that at the same time are relevant to policy makers. Currently he is simultaneously focusing on the following three research topics: 1) detecting methane point sources from satellites using google earth engine and deep learning (TensorFlow); 2) understanding the linkage between particulate matter (PM) pollution and photovoltaic (PV) power output using models of atmospheric composition (GEOS-Chem) and PV performance (PVLIB-Python); and 3) deriving ground-level PM concentrations from satellites using models of atmospheric composition, statistics, and machine learning.

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much! If you are interested in pursuing science by using Earth observation data (e.g. MODIS, VIIRS, etc.), data-driven models (e.g. panel data regression models, geographically weighted regression models, random forests, etc.), process-driven models (e.g. GEOS-Chem, PVLIB-Python, etc.), and so forth, you are welcome to contact me for potential co-operations!
