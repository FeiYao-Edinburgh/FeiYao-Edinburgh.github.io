Dr Yao is currently employed as a NCEO (National Centre for Earth Observation) Research Scientist within GeoSciences which is part of the School of GeoSciences and College of Science and Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. He holds a PhD in Atmospheric and Environmental Science from the University of Edinburgh, a Master's in Geography (Urban and Regional Planning) from Peking University, and a Bachelor's in Geographical Information System from East China Normal University.

The long-term goal of Dr Yaoâ€™s research is to utilize Earth observation data and state-of-science models to address critical research questions that at the same time are relevant to policy makers. At present, he is simultaneously focusing on: 1) Satellite remote sensing of atmospheric composition (aerosols and methane) and 2) Global atmospheric chemistry and climate change as related to energy systems.
