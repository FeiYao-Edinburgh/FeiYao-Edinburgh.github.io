Dr Yao is a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Prof. Paul Palmer at the School of GeoSciences, the University of Edinburgh which is also the place where he obtained his PhD degree in Atmospheric and Environmental Science. Before joining the University of Edinburgh, he obtained his Master’s degree in Geography from Peking University, the best university in China, while he obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Geographical Information Science from East China Normal University, another famous university in China.

The long-term goal of Dr Yao’s research is to utilize Earth observation data and state-of-science models to address critical research questions that at the same time are relevant to policy makers. Currently he is simultaneously focusing on: 1) Atmospheric methane detection using satellite observations; and 2) Global atmospheric chemistry and climate change as related to energy systems.

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. I welcome cooperations!
