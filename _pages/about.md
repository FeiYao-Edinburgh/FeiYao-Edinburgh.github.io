I am a Research Consultant working with Prof. Paul Palmer in the [Atmospheric Composition Modelling Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/). The long-term goal of my research is to utilize Earth observation data and cutting-edge models to address scientific and technical questions that of direct environmental policy relevance. Currently I am simultaneously focusing on the following research topics: 1) Identifying coherent patterns in hyperspectral data associated with the phase transition in desert locusts; 2) Linking particulate matter (PM) pollution with photovoltaic (PV) power output; and 3) Satellite-based estimation of ground-level PM concentrations and associated population exposures.

<!-- at the [School of GeoSciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences), the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) -->

<!-- Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, -->

I expect to obtain my PhD degree from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) soon. The overarching goal of my PhD project is to use a mixture of data and models to understand PM pollution and PV power output with a focus on their links. I obtained my Master’s degree at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), where my research activities centered around using VIIRS AOD to interpret the spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in China, jointly supported by [Jiansheng Wu's group](http://web.pkusz.edu.cn/wujs) of PKU and [Weifeng Li's group](http://fac.arch.hku.hk/upad/wfli/) of the University of Hong Kong. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) (ECNU), where my research career started thanks to several research training programs ECNU provided. I was born in Chizhou of Anhui Province in central China, a small and peaceful city adjacent to the Yangtze River.

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much! If you are interested in pursuing science by using Earth observation data (e.g. MODIS, VIIRS, etc.), data-driven models (e.g. panel data regression models, geographically weighted regression models, random forests, etc.), process-driven models (e.g. GEOS-Chem, PVLIB-Python, etc.), and so forth, you are welcome to contact me for potential co-operations!
