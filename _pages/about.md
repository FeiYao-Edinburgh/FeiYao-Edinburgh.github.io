I am a PhD student working with Prof. Paul Palmer in the [Atmospheric Composition Modelling Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/) at the School of GeoSciences, [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interests lie in the area of understanding spatiotemporal distribution of particulate matter (PM) and PM’s downstream impacts (e.g. population exposure, solar energy, etc.) using multisource data and models.

Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I obtained my Master’s degree at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), where my research activities centered on using VIIRS AOD to interpret the spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. I received my Bachelor’s degree from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) (ECNU), where my research career started thanks to several research training programs ECNU provided. I was born in Chizhou of Anhui Province in central China, a small and peaceful city adjacent to the Yangtze River.

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much! If you are interested in pursuing science by employing satellite remotely sensed data (e.g. MODIS, VIIRS, etc.), data-driven models (e.g. panel data regression models, geographically weighted regression models, random forests, etc.), and process-driven models (e.g. GEOS-Chem, PVLIB-Python, etc.), you are welcome to contact me for potential co-operations!
