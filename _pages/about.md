I am a PhD student working with Prof. Paul Palmer in the [Atmospheric Composition Modeling Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/) at the School of GeoSciences, the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie in the area of understanding global, regional and urban-scale air pollution by using multi-source data and models. My current project mainly focuses on investigating the driving factors that influence the relationship between the satellite-retrieved column aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, with an emphasis over mainland China. Expecting results will inform how to best use satellite-retrieved column AOD to estimate ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, and thereby related economic and health losses.

Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I obtained my Master’s degree at Peking University, where my research activities centered on using VIIRS AOD to interpret the spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. At Peking University, I also engaged in a collaborative research on correcting the saturation problem of DMSP/OLS Nighttime Lights Data based on a new proposed vegetation index, i.e. relative normalized difference vegetation index (RNDVI), in which I performed the experiments, analyzed the data, and contributed analysis tools. I received my Bachelor’s degree from the East China Normal University (ECNU), where my research career started thanks to several research training programs ECNU provided. I was born in Chizhou of Anhui Province in central China, a small and peaceful city adjacent to the Yangtze River.
