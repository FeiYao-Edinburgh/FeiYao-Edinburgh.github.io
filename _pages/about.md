Dr Yao is currently employed as a Research Scientist at the National Centre for Earth Observation, the University of Edinburgh. He holds a PhD in Atmospheric and Environmental Science from the University of Edinburgh, a Master's in Geography (Urban and Regional Planning) from Peking University, and a Bachelor's in Geographical Information System from East China Normal University.

The long-term goal of Dr Yaoâ€™s research is to utilize Earth observation data and state-of-science models to address critical research questions that at the same time are relevant to policy makers. Currently he is simultaneously focusing on: 1) Satellite remote sensing of atmospheric composition (aerosols and methane) and 2) Global atmospheric chemistry and climate change as related to energy systems.

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.

Dr Yao highly welcomes cooperations!
