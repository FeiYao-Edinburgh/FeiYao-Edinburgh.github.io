I am a PhD student working with Prof. Paul Palmer in the [Atmospheric Composition Modeling Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/) at the School of GeoSciences, [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interests lie in the area of understanding global, regional and urban-scale air pollution by using multi-source data and models. Taking mainland China as an illustration, my current project mainly focuses on investigating the driving factors that influence the relationship between the satellite-retrieved column aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, with an emphasis on compositions and vertical profiles of aerosols. Expecting results will further inform how we can properly or best use the satellite-retrieved column AOD to estimate ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, and thereby related economic and health losses.

Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I obtained my Master’s degree at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), where my research activities centered on using VIIRS AOD to interpret the spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. At PKU, I also engaged in a collaborative research on correcting the saturation problem of DMSP/OLS Nighttime Lights data based on a new proposed vegetation index, i.e. relative normalized difference vegetation index, in which I performed the experiments, analyzed the data, and contributed analysis tools. I received my Bachelor’s degree from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) (ECNU), where my research career started thanks to several research training programs ECNU provided. I was born in Chizhou of Anhui Province in central China, a small and peaceful city adjacent to the Yangtze River.
