I am a PhD student working with Prof. Paul Palmer in the [Atmospheric Composition Modelling Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/) at the School of GeoSciences, [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interests primarily lie in leveraging satellite observations and cutting-edge models to understand spatiotemporal variabilities of particulate matter (PM) and PM’s downstream impacts (e.g. population exposure, solar photovoltaic electricity, etc.).

Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I obtained my Master’s degree at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU), where my research activities centered around using VIIRS AOD to interpret the spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in China, jointly supported by [Jiansheng Wu's group](http://web.pkusz.edu.cn/wujs) of PKU and [Weifeng Li's group](http://fac.arch.hku.hk/upad/wfli/) of the University of Hong Kong. I received my Bachelor’s degree from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) (ECNU), where my research career started thanks to several research training programs ECNU provided. I was born in Chizhou of Anhui Province in central China, a small and peaceful city adjacent to the Yangtze River.

Collaboration
======
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much! If you are interested in pursuing science by using satellite remotely sensed data (e.g. MODIS, VIIRS, etc.), data-driven models (e.g. panel data regression models, geographically weighted regression models, random forests, etc.), process-driven models (e.g. GEOS-Chem, PVLIB-Python, etc.), and so forth, you are welcome to contact me for potential co-operations!
