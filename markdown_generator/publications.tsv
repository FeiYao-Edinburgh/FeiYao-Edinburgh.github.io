2016-10-01	VIIRS-based remote sensing estimation of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei: A spatiotemporal statistical model	Remote Sensing of Environment	We proposed a novel spatiotemporal statistical model to estimate ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from the VIIRS-based 6-km EDR AOD over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. This is one of the earliest empirical studies that examine the remote sensing retrievals of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from VIIRS in China.

2019-05-01	A spatially structured adaptive two-stage model for retrieving ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from VIIRS AOD in China	ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing	We proposed a spatially structured adaptive two-stage model to estimate ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from the VIIRS-based 6-km EDR AOD over the entire China. The model can take the heterogeneities of both model predictors and their strength into account.	"<b>Yao Fei</b>, Wu Jiansheng<sup>*</sup>, Li Weifeng<sup>*</sup>, Peng Jian. 2019.
